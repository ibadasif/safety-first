  <h3>cause</h3>
  <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
     It's spread when a person with active TB disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes and
      someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which contain TB bacteria. </p>

  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
  <p>Signs of active TB disease include:

    A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks,
    Chest pain,
    Coughing up blood,
    Feeling tired all the time,
    Night sweats,
    Chills,
    Fever,
    Loss of appetite,
    Weight loss
    </p>

  <h3>Treatment and Care</h3>
  <p>The most common treatment for active TB is isoniazid INH in combination with three other drugsâ€”rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. You may begin to feel better only a few weeks after starting to take the drugs but treating TB takes much longer than other bacterial infections.</p>
