  <h3>cause</h3>
  <p> The cause of appendicitis is not fully understood. However, in most cases,
     a blockage inside the appendix probably starts a process. The blockage may 
     be from a small, hard piece of stool (fecalith), a foreign body, or, rarely,
      even worms. As a result of the blockage, the appendix becomes inflamed and infected.
       If inflammation continues without treatment, the appendix can rupture. A ruptured appendix 
       may cause a pus-filled pocket of infection (abscess) to form. As a result, peritonitis
        (inflammation and usually infection of the abdominal cavity, which may result in a 
        life-threatening infection) may develop.</p>

  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
  <p>Fewer than 50% of people with appendicitis have the traditionally described symptoms in which pain begins 
    in the upper abdomen or around the navel, then nausea and vomiting develop, and then, after a few hours, 
    the nausea passes, and the pain shifts to the right lower portion of the abdomen. When a doctor presses on 
    this area, it is tender, and when the pressure is released, the pain may increase sharply (rebound tenderness). 
    A fever of 100째 to 101째 F (37.7째 to 38.3째 C) is common. Moving and coughing increase the pain.</p>

  <h3>Treatment and Care</h3>
  <p>Surgical removal of the appendix
    Antibiotics and fluids by vein
    Surgery is the main treatment of appendicitis. Delaying surgery until the cause of the abdominal
     pain is certain can be fatal: An infected appendix can rupture less than 36 hours after symptoms begin.
    If appendicitis is found, fluids and antibiotics are given by vein and the appendix is removed (appendectomy).
     If the doctor does an operation and appendicitis is not found, the appendix is usually removed anyway to prevent
      any future risk of appendicitis.</p>
    
  <p> There has been recent interest in treating appendicitis only with antibiotics, so that surgery can be postponed or avoided.
     Although this treatment may be successful in some people, it is still being studied, and surgical removal of the appendix is
      still considered the recommended treatment for appendicitis.</p>
